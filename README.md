# restaurant_billing_sql
# 🍽️ Restaurant Billing & Menu System (SQL Portfolio Project)

This project simulates a basic restaurant billing system using PostgreSQL. It includes tables for menu items, customers, orders, payments, and more — ideal for learning relational database design, SQL queries, and data analysis.

## 🗃️ Database Schema

- **menu**: List of dishes
- **customers**: Customer contact info
- **orders**: Order headers with status
- **order_items**: Line items in orders
- **payments**: Payment transactions

## ✅ Features / Business Questions

1. What is today's income?
2. Which dishes are ordered the most?
3. Which payments are still pending?
4. Who are our top spending customers?
5. What does daily revenue look like?

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Set up PostgreSQL locally
2. Use pgAdmin to create a new database
3. Run `restaurant_billing_schema.sql` to set up schema + sample data
4. Run `restaurant_queries.sql` to test business logic
